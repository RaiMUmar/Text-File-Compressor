Footnotes:
1,"Data quality indicators are based on the coefficient of variation (CV), the non-response errors, the imputation errors, and subject matter expertise: A – Excellent; B - Very good; C - Good; D – Acceptable; E - Use with caution; F - Too unreliable to publish."
2,"Data for the second and third quarters of 2020 are unavailable due to some Statistics Canada operations being temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic."
3,"This table has been archived and replaced by table 14-10-0443-01."
4,"A job is vacant if it meets the following conditions: it is vacant on the reference date (first day of the month) or will become vacant during the month; there are tasks to be carried out during the month for the job in question; and the employer is actively seeking a worker outside the organization to fill the job. The jobs could be full-time, part-time, permanent, temporary, casual, or seasonal. Jobs reserved for subcontractors, external consultants, or other workers who are not considered employees, are excluded."
5,"Occupation estimates are based on the <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/noc/2016/indexV1.3">National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2016</a>."
6,"Includes ‘Unclassified occupations'. Previously released data for the first quarter of 2015 excluded this category."
8,"Improvements were made to the occupation coding procedures starting in the second quarter of 2017. This has resulted in a decrease in the number of vacancies for which the occupation is unclassified. The new coding procedures do not affect the total number of vacancies."
7,"Recruitment strategies are methods used by the employer to fill the job vacancy. Employers can report multiple strategies."
